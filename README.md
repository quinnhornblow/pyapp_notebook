# Example of using PyApp + Jupyter + Windows

This example project has been built with [Rye](https://rye-up.com/). Rye is needed to build the python package and [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to build the .exe using PyApp.

To build the executable, run:

```./build_pyapp_notebook.ps1```

The build currently uses a forked version of PyApp that adds a notebook build options: https://github.com/quinnhornblow/pyapp
